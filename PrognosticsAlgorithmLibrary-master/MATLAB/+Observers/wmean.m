function mX = wmean(X,w)
% wmean   Weighted mean calculation
%
%   mX = wmean(X,w) computes the weighted mean given samples X and weights
%   w. 
%
%   X must be formatted such that the rows are variables and the columns
%   are samples. If X is a vector, then both X and w can be either row or
%   column vectors.
