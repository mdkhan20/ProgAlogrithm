function X = meanCovSampler(estimate,numSamples)
% meanCovSampler  Sample generator given mean and covariance information.
%
%   X = meanCovSampler(estimate,numSamples) generates a set of samples X,
%   which is a matrix with the rows the variables and the columns the
%   samples, given an estimate structure with fields 'mean' and
%   'covariance'. numSamples samples are generated.
%
%   The estimate structure has two fields, 'mean' and 'covariance'. The
%   mean must be a column vector, and the covariance a square matrix of the
%   corresponding size.
% 
%   This function will work with state estimates from the Kalman, extended
%   Kalman, and unscented Kalman filters.
