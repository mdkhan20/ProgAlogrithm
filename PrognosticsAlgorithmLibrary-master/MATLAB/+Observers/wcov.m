% wcov   Weighted covariance calculation
%
%   Pxx = wcov(X,w) computes the covariance matrix for samples X given
%   weights w.
%
%   Pxx = wcov(X,w,alpha,beta) computes the covariance matrix for samples X
%   given weights w and scaling parameters alpha and beta. This form is to
%   be used when the samples provided represent sigma points.
%
%   X must be formatted such that the rows are variables and the columns
%   are samples. If X is a vector, then both X and w can be either row or
%   column vectors.
